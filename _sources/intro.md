# Introduction

The objective of this project is to create customer segments through the application of an unsupervised machine learning model. Employing a straightforward K Means Clustering model, the project utilizes the elbow method and Silhouette scores for model evaluation, providing a structured and insightful approach to defining customer groups.

The data used comes from Kaggle,  [Credit Card Dataset for Clustering](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata).
